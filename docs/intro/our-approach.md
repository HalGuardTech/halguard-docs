# Our Approach: AI Threat Detection for the Generative Era

HalGuard takes a fundamentally **AI-native approach** to security. Traditional fraud defenses like passwords, biometrics, or liveness checks were not built to handle **synthetic media threats**.

## 🛡️ Core Principles

1. **AI vs. AI:** Use machine learning to fight generative attacks.
2. **Real-time by Design:** Deliver fraud decisions within &lt;200ms for live audio streams.
3. **Explainability:** Provide human-readable fraud signals — heatmaps, pitch anomalies, GAN artifacts — not black-box scores.
4. **Adversarial Robustness:** Models trained against **latest GAN architectures and vocoder attacks**.
5. **Compliance-Ready:** Fully auditable detection logs and model versioning for regulatory reviews.

## ⚙️ Why Not Traditional Biometrics?

| Method              | Vulnerability                   |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| Voice Biometrics    | Easily bypassed by cloned voices|
| Face Recognition    | Bypassed by GAN-generated avatars|
| Text-based MFA      | Vulnerable to AI-generated phishing|

HalGuard moves beyond identity **matching** and focuses on **synthetic media detection** — even when the attacker has your real biometrics.

## 🌐 Multi-Modal Defense Strategy

- **Phase 1:** VoiceShield — Clone detection for audio streams.
- **Phase 2:** DeepShield — Deepfake video detection.
- **Phase 3:** TextShield — Generative phishing & LLM misuse detection.
- **Optional:** HalGuard Verify — Content provenance & watermark verification (C2PA support).
