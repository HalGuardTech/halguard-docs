# Current Focus: HalGuard VoiceShield

## üéØ Why Start with Voice Cloning?

- **Immediate market need**: CEO fraud, call center impersonation, KYC spoofing.
- **Real-world attack examples:**  
  - Fraudsters clone CFO voices to approve wire transfers.  
  - AI-generated callers bypass onboarding voiceprint systems.

VoiceShield is our **first product module**, providing **real-time voice clone detection** with explainable risk scoring, built specifically for:

- Banking and Financial Services
- Call Centers and Customer Service Platforms
- KYC / AML Verification Workflows
- Identity Verification Providers

## üõ°Ô∏è How VoiceShield Works (Overview)

1. **Capture:** Ingest audio streams via WebRTC, SIP, or recorded files.
2. **Preprocess:** Denoise, voice-activity detection, packet loss handling.
3. **Analyze:** Extract features (spectrogram, MFCC, pitch variability).
4. **Detect:** Run through an ensemble of models (CNN, BiLSTM, rule engine).
5. **Explain:** Output fraud reasons (e.g., monotone pitch, GAN artifacts, clone probability).

üîç VoiceShield is not speaker verification ‚Äî it is **clone detection**. Even if the clone matches your voiceprint, VoiceShield will detect it.
