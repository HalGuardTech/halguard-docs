# What is HalGuard?

**HalGuard** is an AI-native security platform built to defend organizations against the rising threat of **synthetic media attacks** â€” including **voice cloning, deepfake videos, and generative phishing content**.

As generative AI models become capable of producing human-like voices, faces, and written text, fraudsters are weaponizing these tools to bypass traditional security systems. HalGuard is designed to **detect and prevent these attacks in real-time** with explainable, high-accuracy models.
