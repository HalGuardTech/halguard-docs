# Understanding Generative Threats

## ðŸ¤– What Are Generative Threats?

Generative threats are attacks that leverage **AI-generated content** â€” voice, video, images, or text â€” to impersonate individuals, deceive systems, or manipulate trust-based workflows.

These threats are **not traditional cyberattacks** (like malware or phishing alone) but are designed to **bypass human judgment and biometric defenses** using hyper-realistic synthetic media.

## ðŸŽ­ Types of Generative Threats

| Threat Type            | Description                                      | Example                                 |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Voice Cloning**       | AI-generated replica of a real person's voice   | CEO fraud call authorizing wire transfer |
| **Deepfake Videos**     | Manipulated video where face or speech is faked | Video of a politician saying false statements |
| **Synthetic Phishing Text** | AI-written emails that mimic human writing patterns | Targeted phishing written via ChatGPT |
| **Prompt Injection Attacks** | Abuse of LLMs to output harmful or sensitive information | Jailbreaking a chatbot for inappropriate outputs |

## ðŸ“ˆ Why Are Generative Threats Hard to Detect?

- **High Fidelity:** Modern GANs, TTS models, and LLMs create outputs nearly indistinguishable from real content.
- **Fast Accessibility:** Tools like ElevenLabs, Midjourney, GPT-4, and Stable Diffusion are publicly available.
- **Zero-Day Risk:** New vocoders, video GANs, and LLM jailbreaks are constantly evolving.

## ðŸš© The New Attack Surface

| Traditional Security Defenses | Vulnerable to GenAI Threats?  |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Passwords & 2FA                | âœ… Yes â€” phishing bypass     |
| Voice Biometrics               | âœ… Yes â€” cloned voice matches print |
| Liveness Detection             | âœ… Yes â€” high-fidelity GANs can spoof |
| Static Video Verification      | âœ… Yes â€” lip sync fakes, facial swaps |

## ðŸŽ¯ The HalGuard Approach

HalGuard focuses on **detecting synthetic generation patterns themselves** â€” not identity matching. We analyze artifacts, pitch variation, GAN noise, and AI-specific footprints to **catch the fakes, even when the identity matches.**
