## üõ°Ô∏è Killshot Strategy: Benchmark Challenge

Launch the **VoiceShield Detection Challenge**:

- Public benchmarking of detection accuracy vs. major clone generators (ElevenLabs, Tortoise-TTS, Respeecher).
- Show real-world performance against zero-day clones.
- Transparently compare detection latency and false positive rates.

‚úÖ Builds trust with the developer community.  
‚úÖ Positions HalGuard as **open, measurable, and trustworthy** in a space full of black-box claims.
