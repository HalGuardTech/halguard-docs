# Market Landscape: AI-Generated Threat Detection

The rise of **voice cloning, deepfake videos, and generative phishing** has created a new category of security risks that traditional fraud detection tools are not equipped to handle.

While many vendors offer **biometric matching** or **basic liveness checks**, very few directly address **synthetic generation detection** â€” especially in **real-time scenarios**.

## âš¡ Opportunity Gap

- **No dominant voice clone detection provider exists.**
- Many products focus on **matching the speaker** â€” not verifying whether the voice is real or synthetic.
- Real-time detection for **live calls and streams** remains largely unsolved.

âœ… **HalGuard VoiceShield** targets this gap directly.
