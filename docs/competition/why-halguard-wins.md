# Why HalGuard Wins

VoiceShield is not just "another fraud API." Itâ€™s a **purpose-built generative AI threat defense system** designed to detect and explain synthetic voice attacks, even when traditional biometrics fail.

## ðŸ’£ The Biometrics Blind Spot

| Attack Scenario                   | Biometric Systems Result           | VoiceShield Result                      |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| CEO clone calls CFO for urgent transfer | Passes voiceprint check            | Detected as synthetic, flagged instantly |
| Cloned customer voice at call center  | Passes speaker match               | Detected as clone, action: block/flag    |
| KYC onboarding with TTS-generated voice | No prior voiceprint, passes liveness | Detected via lack of vocal micro-tremors |
