# VoiceShield Use Cases

VoiceShield delivers **real-time voice clone detection** across key fraud-prone workflows where traditional systems fail.

---

## üè¶ 1. CEO Fraud & Wire Transfer Authorization

**The Attack:**  
A fraudster clones the CFO's voice using audio scraped from interviews or webinars. They call the finance team, urgently requesting a high-value transfer.

**The Problem:**  
Voice sounds correct. Caller ID may be spoofed. The finance team believes the request is genuine.

**How VoiceShield Prevents This:**  
- Detects over-regularized pitch (AI speech smoothness).  
- Flags GAN artifacts in the voice signal.  
- Provides real-time risk scoring during the call ‚Äî before the transaction is approved.

## ‚òéÔ∏è 2. Call Center Impersonation

**The Attack:**  
Fraudster uses a cloned customer voice to bypass phone-based security questions and reset account access.

**The Problem:**  
Call center agents trust the voice as proof of identity.

**VoiceShield Defense:**  
- Works on any caller ‚Äî no need for pre-enrolled voiceprint.  
- Flags synthetic speech patterns within the first few seconds of the call.

## üßë‚Äçüíº 3. KYC / AML Identity Verification

**The Attack:**

- Adds clone detection to KYC workflows without replacing your existing ID systems.
