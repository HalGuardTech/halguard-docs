# VoiceShield Product Roadmap

---

## âœ… Phase 1 (Current MVP)

- Real-time voice clone detection (&lt;200ms latency).
- API-first access for streaming and batch analysis.
- Fraud signal explainability (confidence, reasons).
- SIP / WebRTC integrations (Twilio, AWS Connect, Genesys).
- Adversarially robust models trained on real & synthetic voices.

---

## ðŸŸ  Phase 2 (Upcoming)

- Multilingual voice clone detection support.
- Deep signal fingerprinting (waveform-level GAN anomaly detection).
- Enhanced behavioral metadata enrichment (geo IP analysis, device fingerprinting).
- Detection tuning by vertical (banking, telecom, KYC-specific thresholds).

---

## ðŸ”µ Phase 3 (Planned)

- Cross-channel clone detection (voice + video fusion).
- Integration with HalGuard DeepShield (video) and TextShield (synthetic phishing).
- Public detection benchmark leaderboard.
- Partner integrations (anti-fraud platforms, identity verification tools).

---

## ðŸš€ Continuous Innovation

- Weekly model retraining and dataset expansion.
- Zero-day attack coverage with model drift monitoring.
- Community-driven fraud feedback loop.
