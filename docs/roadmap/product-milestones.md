# HalGuard Product Roadmap & Milestones

HalGuard’s mission is to deliver **multi-modal synthetic media threat detection** — starting with real-time **voice clone detection** (VoiceShield), and expanding into video deepfakes (DeepShield) and generative phishing (TextShield).

This roadmap outlines our **phased product development plan** and key feature rollouts.

---

## ✅ Phase 1 (Current): VoiceShield (Real-Time Voice Clone Detection)

- ✅ Real-time streaming detection (&lt;200ms latency).
- ✅ Batch analysis for recorded calls (S3, URL upload).
- ✅ Explainable fraud signals (pitch anomaly, GAN artifacts, etc.).
- ✅ Webhook-based fraud alerts and reporting.
- ✅ Model versioning, drift monitoring, and rollback.
- ✅ Developer-first REST APIs and SDK examples (Python, Node.js).

---

## 🟠 Phase 2 (Planned, Q3–Q4 2025): DeepShield (Video Deepfake Detection)

- 🎥 Lip sync inconsistency detection.
- 🖼️ GAN-based artifact fingerprinting in video streams.
- 📡 Support for WebRTC streams and recorded video files.
- 💡 Explainable detection heatmaps and confidence scoring.
- 🔗 Integration with C2PA watermarking standards.

---

## 🔵 Phase 3 (Planned, 2026): TextShield (Synthetic Phishing & LLM Misuse Detection)

- ✉️ Detection of LLM-generated phishing attempts.
- 📜 Prompt injection and jailbreak monitoring.
- 💬 GPT-originated content identification (probabilistic scoring).
- 🚩 Real-time alerts for phishing emails, chatbot misuse, and customer service chat flows.

---

## 🟢 Cross-Phase Features (Continuous Improvement)

- Continuous adversarial training with **new vocoder attacks and GAN clones**.
- Public **HalGuard Benchmark Challenge** for clone detection.
- Developer sandbox expansion and **low-code integration kits**.
- Multi-modal fusion (voice + video + text correlation) for fraud scoring.
