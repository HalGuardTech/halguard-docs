# System Overview: VoiceShield Detection Architecture

The VoiceShield detection system is designed for **real-time voice clone detection** with sub-200ms latency across live streams and recordings. It leverages an ensemble of models and signal-processing techniques to identify **synthetic voice artifacts** and generate explainable fraud signals.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Design Principles
- Real-Time First: Designed to process 500ms chunks of audio at a time with sub-200ms end-to-end latency.

- Adversarial Robustness: Defends against GAN-based vocoder attacks, white noise perturbations, and packet loss.

- Explainability: Outputs reason codes and feature-level confidence alongside the risk score.

- Scalable: Microservices architecture with stateless APIs, GPU-accelerated inference, and autoscaling support.

- Deployment Flexibility: SaaS, on-prem, and edge-ready.
