Voice cloning uses **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** models or **neural vocoders** to create synthetic audio that mimics a real person's voice, tone, and accent ‚Äî often using only a few minutes of sample recordings.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Technologies Behind Voice Cloning

| Method                   | Description                          |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Text-to-Speech (TTS)      | Converts text into human-like speech using neural networks |
| GAN-based Vocoders        | Generate realistic speech waveforms with smooth, natural sounds |
| Autoregressive Models     | Predict each next audio frame based on previous frames (e.g., Tacotron) |
| Diffusion Models          | Improve sample quality with noise-to-signal generation |

## üéØ How Attackers Use Voice Cloning

- Scrape interviews, webinars, podcasts, or voicemails.
- Feed samples into tools like **ElevenLabs, Respeecher, Tortoise-TTS**.
- Generate cloned voices to impersonate executives, customers, or victims.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why Voice Clones Are Dangerous

| Target Workflow         | Impact                               |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Wire Transfer Approval   | Fraudster calls finance team as CFO   |
| Call Center Authentication | Reset passwords using cloned voice |
| KYC Identity Verification| Pass liveness checks with synthetic speech |

## üéõÔ∏è Common Cloning Artifacts (What HalGuard Detects)

- Over-regularized **pitch contour** (F0 flattening).
- Lack of **jitter and shimmer** (vocal micro-tremors).
- GAN **spectrogram artifacts**.
- Harmonic smoothing in **MFCC features**.
