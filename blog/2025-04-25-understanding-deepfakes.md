Deepfakes are synthetic media generated using AI models like **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)** or **autoencoders** to convincingly manipulate video, audio, or images.

## üé≠ How Deepfakes Work

1. **Data Collection:** Gather images, video, or audio samples of the target.
2. **Model Training:** Train AI models to learn visual or vocal patterns.
3. **Synthesis:** Use trained models to generate new content.

## üö© Risks of Deepfakes

| Use Case                    | Potential Risk                         |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Wire Transfer Fraud          | Fake CEO calls requesting payments     |
| Political Misinformation     | Videos of politicians making false claims |
| Brand Damage                 | Investor calls or corporate statements faked via video or audio |

## üõ°Ô∏è Why Detection Matters

As deepfake generation tools improve, real-time detection becomes critical to prevent fraud, misinformation, and social engineering attacks.
